# CBoard
Simulate keyboard inputs in C++. Still very in progress, especially for typewrite(). Inspired by PyAutoGui after a complaint about how much more difficult it was to simulate key events in C++ with X11.

## Requirements
X11 and X11/extensions

## Compile
Make sure to add -lX11 and -lXtst as your flags.
